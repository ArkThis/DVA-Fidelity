Notes about the audio test signal in DVA-Fidelity analyzer version 2
2013-09-07

1) continous tone
    This is for detecting errors up to single samples in the signal

    The idea for checking sample differences is as follows:
    - Generate 2 sine waves:
        - Have a low frequency on one channel
        - Have a high frequency on the other channel

    The plan is to compare generated sine values to the recorded samples.


    Now, an analysis tool could be written, which does the following:

    a) Gather wave properties for reference comparison:

    In order to be comparable to a sine generated by the analysis programm, the incoming waves must be analyzed to
    find (a) a starting point for analysis and (b) the actual amplitude of the signal.

    - Search the input recording for a 0-crossing
    - Start at the 0-crossing and iterate through the samples, until the next sample is smaller than the previous one = peak found
      NOTE: In order to avoid false positives here, remember the first peak. Then scan for the next 0-crossing.
            Repeat, iteration through the samples like before, until finding the next peak.
            Their sample values should match (given a deviation value as parameter).
    - In case the detected 2 peaks don't match:
        This could mean that one of the peaks is an error in the sine wave.
        Therefore, one could continue to search 0-crossings+peaks, until more than a certain number of detected peaks match.
        Taking the sample value of the peak can be used as reference value to adjust the generated sine's amplitude for comparison.


    b) Compare the incoming (=recorded) audio signal to generated sine function values:
    
    - Freshly calculate the sine values for each sample (requires samplerate as parameter)
    - Iterate through the values of the generated sine - sample by sample:
        - Scale the recorded sample value, according to previously detected peak value
        - Compare it to the recorded wave's sample value at that position
    - If the generated and the recorded sample value differ beyond a given threshold: ERROR detected!
    

    == Considerations:
    - How to eliminate the sync-beeps to sabotage this check?


2) sync beeps
    - phase inverted L/R:
        This allows immediate sync-verification by adding L+R:
        If any parts of the sync beeps are still visible, converter quality should be questioned.


3) quality test signals
    - noise (white? pink? brown?)
    - frequency sweep
    - impulse
